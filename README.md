## Tech Stack

This search experience is powered by <a href="https://typesense.org" target="_blank">Typesense</a> which is
a blazing-fast, <a href="https://github.com/typesense/typesense" target="_blank">open source</a> typo-tolerant
search-engine. It is an open source alternative to Algolia and an easier-to-use alternative to ElasticSearch.

This demo uses a geo-distributed 3-node Typesense cluster running on <a href="https://cloud.typesense.org" target="_blank">Typesense Cloud</a>,
with nodes in Oregon, Frankfurt and Mumbai.
